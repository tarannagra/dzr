## ⬇️ Requirements

You will need Python. I use `3.12.0`, you'll need one that is latest for sure though.

I recommend you to use a virtual environment for this, I use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) which is insanely quick!

```bash
uv venv
# activate it
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running

Running is as simple as:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

When loaded, you *should* see the following screen:

& in the input, type in `help` to get a list of available commands!
